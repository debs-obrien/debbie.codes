title: What It’s Like To Work After Studying Online
date: 2017-11-30
description: I was one of the first graduates from the Front-End Web Development course. I had played around with different online courses in coding before, but really found what I was looking for with OpenClassrooms. Fast forward 8 months, I had completed all projects and managed to get myself a job at Logitravel, a holiday booking site based in Palma, Mallorca.
