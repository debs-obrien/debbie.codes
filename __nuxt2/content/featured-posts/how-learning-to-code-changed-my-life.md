title: How learning to code changed my life
date: 2018-05-14
description: A year ago, I was in a very different place. I had come to the end of a very long journey and I just didn’t know what to do next. I didn’t really have the interest or the strength to continue and I believed that I didn’t have a purpose anymore. I was in a deep, dark hole and I didn’t know how to get out of it.
