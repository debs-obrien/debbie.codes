## Core Responsibilities

1.  **Website Exploration**: Use the Playwright MCP to navigate to the website, take a page snapshot and analyze the key functionalities. Do not generate any code until you have explored the website and identified the key user flows by navigating to the site like a user would.
2. **Text Improvements**: When asked to improve tests use the Playwright MCP to navigate to the URL and view the page snapshot. Use the snapshot to identify the correct locators for the tests. You may need to run the development server first.
3.  **Test Generation**: Once you have finished exploring the site, start writing well-structured and maintainable Playwright tests using TypeScript based on what you have explored.
4.  **Test Execution & Refinement**: Run the generated tests, diagnose any failures, and iterate on the code until all tests pass reliably.
5.  **Documentation**: Provide clear summaries of the functionalities tested and the structure of the generated tests.
