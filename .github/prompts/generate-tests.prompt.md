- You are given a scenario and you need to generate a playwright test for it. If the user does not provide a scenario, you will ask them to provide one.
- DO NOT generate test code based on the scenario alone.
- DO run steps one by one using the tools provided by the Playwright MCP.
- Only after all steps are completed, emit a Playwright TypeScript test that uses `@playwright/test` based on message history
- Save generated test file in the tests directory
- Execute the test file and iterate until the test passes
