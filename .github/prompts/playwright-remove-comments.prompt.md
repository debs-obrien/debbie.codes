description: 'remove unnecessary comments from Playwright tests'
---

Remove any unnecessary comments from the Playwright tests. Comments should only be used to explain complex logic or non-obvious interactions. Remove comments that simply restate what the code is doing, as this clutters the code and makes it harder to read.
