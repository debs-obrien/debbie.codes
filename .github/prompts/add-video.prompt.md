# Add a new video

You can add a new video by creating a new file in the `content/videos` directory.

Add a new video using the MCP server to navigate to the URL to get the required info you need. 
- Ask the user for the url if not provided.
- Do not invent titles and descriptions. 
- Do not add extra tags only add ones that already exist in the other video files. 
- Make sure the date for the video is correct. If you do not know the date ask for it.
- Make sure you add a host
- Close the browser when done.
