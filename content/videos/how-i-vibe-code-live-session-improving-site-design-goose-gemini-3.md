title: How I Vibe Code - Live session on improving my site design with Goose and Gemini 3
date: 2025-11-20
description: This is such a fun session where I tested out Gemini 3 LLM along with Goose as my coding agent to improve my site design. Watch as I try to tell it what I want and my reaction at the matrix style hero it gave me. Very cool and impressive what it can do in such a short space of time.
