title: Playwright MCP + Chrome Extension Testing with Logged-In Profiles
date: 2025-08-21
description: Before the Playwright MCP Browser Extension, using a logged-in state with the Playwright MCP server often meant giving your login credentials to the LLM. Now, with the extension, you can securely reuse your existing browser profile â€” no passwords required. The LLM can run tests against a session that's already authenticated.
