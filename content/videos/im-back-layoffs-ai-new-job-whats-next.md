I'm back ❤️ After a few very quiet months, layoffs, big life changes, and a lot of reflection — I'm starting a brand new chapter at Block, diving deep into AI… and I wanted to share the journey with you. In this video I talk honestly about:

- what the last few months have really been like after being laid off
- why I disappeared from YouTube for a while
- how hard (and emotional) career transitions can be
- the amazing community support that helped me through
- shifting my focus from testing into AI
- experimenting with AI tools, building apps, and rediscovering creativity
- advice and encouragement for anyone going through layoffs or career changes right now

This isn't a polished tutorial — it's a real talk while out on a run in the forest 🌳 about growth, resilience, learning, and what comes next. And yes… I'm back — and I'm excited to bring you along for the journey ahead.

💬 If you're going through layoffs or career changes… You're not alone. Keep going. Keep learning. And keep believing in yourself ❤️
