---

I have over 10 years experience in Frontend development and have worked as a Tech Lead and consultant for many important clients with varios technologies and often with a strong focus on performance. I have lead teams both in house and remotely as well as giving workshops and training. I have many years of experience as a mentor for online learning platforms, Treehouse and OpenClassrooms and am a teacher at [Vue School](https://vueschool.io/courses/internationalization-with-vue-i18n) as well as [Jamstack Explorers](https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/get-started-with-nuxt) and I am a writer for [Ultimate Courses](https://ultimatecourses.com/author/debbieobrien).

I am a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in developer technologies, Google Developer Expert in web technologies, GitHub Star, Cloudinary Media Developer Expert, Auth0 Ambassador and Nuxt Ambassador.

I have a special love for JavaScript frameworks especially Vue.js and Nuxt.js and improving performance with webpack and of course the Jamstack and am an Open Source Contributor. I have a Frontend and FullStack Tech Degree and am Microsoft certified. I am an [international speaker](https://noti.st/debbie), and have spoken at many meet-ups and conferences worldwide on many continents including Antarctica.

I am Irish but live in Mallorca, Spain and when I am not writing code and studying new technologies you can find me doing all sorts of sports from running, cycling and skiing, body combat and of course Taekwondo as I am a 4th degree black belt.
