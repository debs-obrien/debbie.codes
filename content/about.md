---

With over 15 years experience in Frontend development I have worked as a Tech Lead and consultant for many important clients with various technologies and often with a strong focus on performance. I have lead teams both in house and remotely as well as giving workshops and training. I have many years of experience as a mentor for online learning platforms, Treehouse and OpenClassrooms and am a teacher at [Vue School](https://vueschool.io/courses/internationalization-with-vue-i18n) as well as [Jamstack Explorers](https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/get-started-with-nuxt), and I am a writer for [Ultimate Courses](https://ultimatecourses.com/author/debbieobrien).

I am a Principal Technical Program manager at Microsoft, Google Developer Expert in web technologies, Nuxt Ambassador, and am a former Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in developer technologies, Media Developer Expert and GitHub star alumni.

I have a special love for JavaScript frameworks especially Vue.js and Nuxt.js and am now focused on testing especially end to end testing with Playwright. I have a Frontend and FullStack Tech Degree and am Microsoft certified. I am an international speaker, and have spoken at many meet-ups and conferences worldwide on many continents including Antarctica.

I am Irish but live in Mallorca, Spain and when I am not writing code and studying new technologies you can find me doing all sorts of sports from running, cycling and skiing, body combat and of course Taekwondo as I am a 4th degree black belt.
