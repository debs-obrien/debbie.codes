title: Advanced i18n in Nuxt using Interpolations
date: 2020-06-17
description: With Nuxt components you can auto import your components really easily and even comes with support for dynamic imports otherwise known as lazy loading. That means you can just add your component in the template without having to add it to the script tag. This makes development much faster.
