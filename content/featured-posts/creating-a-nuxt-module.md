title: Creating a Nuxt Module
date: 2020-11-27
description: Modules are functions that are called sequentially when booting Nuxt. The framework waits for each module to finish before continuing. In this way, modules can customize almost any aspect of your project. Nuxt modules can be incorporated into npm packages. This makes them easy to reuse across projects and to share with the community.
