If you've ever needed to test an application that requires authentication, you know the pain: logging in every time or, worse, handing over your credentials to an LLM.

With the new **Playwright MCP Browser Extension** for Chrome and Edge, that's no longer necessary. You can now launch the MCP server against an **existing browser profile** â€” one that's already logged in â€” and test your app.

## Why This Matters for Testers

Previously, using the Playwright MCP server meant:

- Starting from a **clean browser state**
- Manually logging in every time
- Or passing credentials into the LLM (not ideal for security!)

Now, you can:
âœ… Reuse a browser profile you already use for testing
âœ… Start directly in a logged-in session
âœ… Run Playwright MCP commands in that context

This opens up more realistic testing workflows for QA engineers, especially when working with enterprise apps that live behind authentication.

## Installing the Playwright MCP Browser Extension

The extension is available for **Chrome, Edge, or any Chromium-based browser**.

- Download the [Playwright MCP extension](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/blob/main/extension/README.md).
- Unzip the file.
- Open `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions` in your browser.
- Enable **Developer Mode**.
- Click **Load unpacked** and select the extension folder.

You'll now see the **Playwright MCP Bridge** in your extensions list.

## Configuring the MCP Server

Next, configure your Playwright MCP server to use the extension.

- In VS Code, go to the MCP server settings.
- Add the `--extension` flag to enable extension support.
- If you don't have the Playwright MCP extension installed yet, you can do so directly from VS Code.

```json
"playwright": {
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "@playwright/mcp@latest",
    "--extension"
  ],
},
```

**Tip**: In VS Code from the extensions tab you can install Playwright MCP server and then use the gear icon to choose the "show configuration JSON" option to easily add "--extension".

That's it â€” your MCP server is now aware of the extension.

## Testing on a Logged-In Profile

Here's the exciting part:

- Open your browser on the profile you want to use and login to the site you want to test (e.g. GitHub).
- Start your MCP server and ask it to Navigate to a site.
- Choose the tab you want the MCP Server to connect to.

From there, you can instruct Copilot in Agent mode to interact with your app in a **logged-in state**. For example:

- Navigating to your profile page
- Changing account settings
- Generating tests for authenticated user flows

In my demo, I updated GitHub profile pronouns â€” and MCP handled it seamlessly from the logged-in session.

## Why This is a Game-Changer

This extension makes it possible to:

- Test **real user sessions** without worrying about logging-in
- Run automation against enterprise apps that require authentication
- Keep your login credentials **safe** by staying within your own profile

For testers, this means **faster setup, more realistic tests, and improved security**.
