title: CityJSConf talks to…Debbie O’Brien
date: 2020-09-07
description: “I guess you could say I love the buzz of the stage but also because my talks help people learn something new. Now the virtual world is not the same at all, but what can we do? I don’t dislike it — I would just prefer to see and talk to people. I am very much a people’s person.”
