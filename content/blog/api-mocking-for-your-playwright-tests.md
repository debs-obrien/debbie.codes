title: API Mocking for your Playwright tests
date: 2023-07-04
description: When working with third party API's it is better to mock the API call rather than hit the API especially when they are API's that you do not control. Mocking the API allows you to finish developing your component or app and write the tests and then when the API is ready you can just swap out the mock for the real API call.
