title: A better global setup in Playwright reusing login with project dependencies
date: 2023-03-15
description: When you use global setup, you don't see a trace for the setup part of your tests and the setup doesn't appear in the HTML report. This can make debugging difficult. It's also not possible to use fixtures in global setup. In order to fix this issue, project dependencies were created.
