Installing MCP(Model Context Protocol) servers in Visual Studio Code just got a major upgrade! With the latest update, you'll notice a new MCP Servers section in the Extensions panel. Here you will find all the MCP servers you already have installed. You should also see a "world" icon for browsing MCP Servers.

## Getting Started

- Open VS Code and click on the Extensions panel
- Under extensions is a new section called MCP Servers Installed
- Look for the new globe/world icon and click it to launch the MCP server browser

## Browse Available MCP Servers

You'll be greeted by a curated list of available MCP servers, each with a description and quick actions.

## Install an MCP Server

Find the server you want and click the Install button.
This will open a web link that triggers VS Code to handle the installation for you.

Confirm the install in VS Codeâ€”no need to copy-paste commands or hunt for repositories.

## Manage Your Servers

Once installed, your MCP servers appear in the extension's sidebar.
You can start or stop servers with a single click.

Click on a server to view its README, check documentation, or access configuration options directly from the UI.

Give it a try and see how much easier MCP server installation can be!
