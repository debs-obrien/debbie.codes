You might've seen the news: the Linux Foundation has launched the Agentic AI Foundation, and with it comes some big contributions — including Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agents.md, and Goose. In this video, I take a first real look at Goose, a local-first, open-source AI agent framework released in early 2025 by Block — and I show you something genuinely impressive.

I was trying (and failing 😅) to install the Goose CLI on macOS. Everything looked correct… but the goose command just wouldn't work. Instead of spending hours debugging Zsh configs and PATH issues, I let Goose help.

And here's the cool part 👇

Goose:
- Detected a syntax error in my .zshrc
- Found that two PATH exports were accidentally merged into one line
- Safely edited my config file
- Explained exactly why my terminal wasn't picking up the changes

This is a great real-world example of agentic AI actually doing work, not just answering questions.

As developers, we don't have all the answers — and that's okay. The key is knowing how to use AI to get unstuck faster. Have fun, play around with Goose (or any coding agent), and don't be afraid to push back when the AI gets it wrong, iteration is where the magic happens ✨
