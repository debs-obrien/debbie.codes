title: Setup a local dev server for your Playwright tests
date: 2023-03-07
description: Playwright comes with a webserver option in the config file which gives you the ability to launch a local dev server before running your tests. This is ideal for when writing your tests during development and when you don't have a staging or production url to test against.
