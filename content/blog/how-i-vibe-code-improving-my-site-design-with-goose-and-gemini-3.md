OK this was so much fun: Google's Gemini 3 is amazing. I just got it to redesign my home page. I was having fun with this one so no real idea what I wanted just vibing along. It gave me a matrix style hero component which blew me away. This is so cool and the fact that I can spend less than an hour to improve my personal site is insane.

I used goose coding agent for this one which is open source and free and I just put my Gemini API key in which I am still using a free trial so my total cost for having fun was zero.

Was quite impressed that by giving Goose the link to an image it just downloaded it for me and added it to my public folder of my site. One less tedious task for me to do.

Towards the end I had the crazy idea of creating 7 hero component designs that change when you refresh the page. Why? Cause it's cool. This is maybe not how you build production apps but it sure is great for prototyping and getting to learn how new tools work and improving your communication with AI Agents and LLMs.

I encourage you all to take time out of your day and play around. Build a personal site even if you never deploy it. Improve your personal site and modify the design just for fun. Have fun cause Gemini 3 is pretty amazing and the tools we have available to us right now is insane.

And of course don't forget to run the Playwright healer agent after you have changed your design so your tests are updated. All it takes is a prompt. I didn't show it in this video but check out my other videos on Playwright Agents.

Have fun and happy vibe coding
