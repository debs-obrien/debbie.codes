date: 2026-01-19
description: In this episode, I'm joined by Debbie O'Brien, long-time Playwright advocate and testing expert, to talk about the future of software testing, automation, and AI-driven workflows. Debbie recently transitioned out of the Playwright core team and now continues her work as a Playwright ambassador. We talk openly about what that change means, how she views the future of Playwright, and what's next for her personally and professionally.
