title: Static generated sites === great performance. What are you waiting for?
date: 2020-03-26
description: Statically generated sites are the future. Seriously. With frameworks like Nuxt we can build really cool sites that look and feel like a single page application but are actually static generated. That means no need for a server but most importantly performance is amazing. Everything is generated at build time.
