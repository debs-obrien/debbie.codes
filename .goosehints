# Goose Hints for debbie.codes

## Verification Workflow
- PRs generate a deploy preview automatically — use that to verify changes
- No need to run a local dev server or take screenshots for PRs

## Content Guidelines
- Podcasts are stored in `content/podcasts/` directory
- Use only existing tags found in other content files
- Always include: title, date, description, url, image, tags, and host for podcasts
- Upload images to Cloudinary under `debbie.codes/` folder structure
